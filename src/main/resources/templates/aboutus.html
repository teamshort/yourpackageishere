    <p>"Hello, I am an Air Force Veteran turned coder.
        I have spent the past year working as a developer and I'm currently a Software Development Engineering Apprentice at Amazon.
        I have been programming for several years now and after continually facing those challenges and triumphs,
        the one thing that was most apparent to me was that I was how growing after those experiences.
        Not just in skills but in other aspects as well. That is something that has resonated with me about Technology,
        is the fact that it's constantly encouraging and innovating growth.
        I'm personally excited to continue my growth at Amazon by building applications that not only,
        reach users and inspire them to grow, but to also continue the growth and impact that technology has in our everyday lives and future."</p>

    <p>"I am a Software Developer working with AWS as an SDE Apprentice. I am from Long Island, New York.
        I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Programming & Information Systems in SUNY Farmingdale State College.
        I studied art and biology prior to finding my interest in technology.
        I discovered my passion for coding in college after taking the programming 1 course they have as an elective when I was a Bioscience major.
        What I like about programming is that it was both technical and artistic at the same time.
        Some fun facts about me would be my love for animals, dogs especially." </p></p>
