    <h4>Reina Vencer</h4>
    <p>"I am a Software Developer working with AWS as an SDE Apprentice. I am from Long Island, New York.
        I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Programming & Information Systems in SUNY Farmingdale State College.
        I studied art and biology prior to finding my interest in technology.
        I discovered my passion for coding in college after taking the programming 1 course they have as an elective when I was a Bioscience major.
        What I like about programming is that it was both technical and artistic at the same time.
        Some fun facts about me would be my love for animals, dogs especially." </p></p>
