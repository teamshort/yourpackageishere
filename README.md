### Problem Domain
When you receive an email from usps that you package has been delivered, Tenants are unsure if the package has been delivered to the apartment office or not. 
So using our app, building managers can scan the qr code in the package which will automatic send the email to the tenant that their package is in the office for pickup. Tenants are assured that
their package has been delivered and is safe stored in office.  


### User Stories
- MVP User Stories As a Tenant, I want to receive emails about packages that have arrived so I know it has been received.

- As a Building manager, I want to be able to log in and add tenants, so that I can send them emails when packages are received.
- As a Building manager, I want to be able to log in and edit tenants, if they happen to change apartments or emails.
- As a Building manager, I want to be able to log in and delete tenants, if they move or are no longer residing.

- As a Building manager, I want to be able to log in and scan packages, So an auto generated email will notify my tenants of packages.


### Stretch User Stories

### Frameworks & Technologies Used
   - Spring Boot (MVC)
   - Bootstrap
   - Java
   
   
### API and Library

   - [nimiq/qr-scanner Library](https://github.com/nimiq/qr-scanner)
   
   
### Starter Guide

- The Building manager will first visit the website and create an account for their building. 
- They will then add all the tenants information in their account.
- After a package arrives, the building manager can go to 'scan package' tab in 'building' which will open a webcam. If using mobile devices it will 
open the mobile camera.
- Scan the package which will auto populate the tenant's information in a form. 
- Click submit to send the email.
- After the submit button is clicked there will be a notification which will inform the user if the email has been sent. If there is no tenant by that name it will send an email to all of the tenants in that apartment. 
- If there are no matches it will give a message saying that there were no tenants found.

           git clone https://github.com/teamshort/yourpackageishere.git

2. Make sure you have Postgres installed in your local machine. You must first create a database named 'yourpackageishere' in psql with command:
            
           CREATE DATABASE yourpackageishere;
           
3. On your application.properties, make sure postgres is set up on with your individual user environment variables

        spring.datasource.url=${DATABASE_URL}
        spring.datasource.username=${DATABASE_USERNAME}
        spring.datasource.password=${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
        spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.lob.non_contextual_creation=true
        server.port=5000
    
    Also, include a SendGrid API Key on your environment variables with variable name:
     
        SENDGRID_API_KEY

4. Run the application through your IDE or use the terminal command:
        
        ./gradlew bootrun

5. You will now be able to run the application on your local machine with URL:

        http://localhost:5000
